    <div><b>Abstract:</b> The state-of-the-art, end-to-end TTS training, which can predict speech directly from a given sequence of graphemes or phonemes,  has shown improved performance over the conventional TTS approach. However, its predicting capability is limited by the acoustic/phonetic coverage and the amount of the training data. The synthesized speech quality in its pronunciation, break and prosody, can still be further improved. We propose to enhance the TTS performance by exploiting the information embedded in a syntactically parsed tree which can capture the inter-phrase/word information encoded in a sentence. With words grouped in a multi-layered syntactic tree, we investigate two key linguistic features in such a structure, i.e., the phrase structure and the relations between adjacent words. Results of subjective assessment in quality test, measured on three test sentence sets, show that the proposed approach is effective to generalize the prediction capability of the end-to-end TTS and to improve the corresponding intelligibility, naturalness and prosody of the synthesized speech.</div>
